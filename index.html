    <p>
    I'm a postdoctoral research fellow at Princeton University and NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory. Prior to this, I got my PhD in climate science from the University of Oxford.
    </p>
	
    <p>
    I study the physics of clouds, radiation and circulation, with a focus on how these processes shape Earth's climate and its response to forcing. This is a broad endeavor, and so my work touches on a number of topics, for example: tropical dynamics, radiative feedbacks, the hydrological cycle and aerosol-climate interactions.

    <p>
    I am actively involved in climate science outreach through <a style="color:gray" href="https://www.climateupclose.org/">Climate Up Close</a>.

   <p> <span style="font-weight:bold;"> August 2024 </span> &nbsp <span  style="color:gray" > I spent a week in New Hampshire doing climate science outreach with <a style="color:gray" href="https://www.climateupclose.org/">Climate Up Close</a>. It was fantastic to connect with local New Hampshire residents and to help them grapple with the science and implications of climate change. For a glimpse into one of our events, take a look at this excellent <a style="color:gray" href="https://www.nhpr.org/nh-news/2024-08-02/got-questions-about-global-warming-these-climate-scientists-are-touring-nh-with-answers">NHPR article</a>. </span> &nbsp </p>
	  
   <p> <span style="font-weight:bold;"> June 2024 </span> &nbsp <span  style="color:gray" > I presented my work on the response of convective mass fluxes to warming at the <a style="color:gray" href="https://sites.bc.edu/cfmip2024/">CFMIP conference</a> (which I helped to organize) and at AOFD in Burlington. </span> &nbsp </p>
	  
   <p> <span style="font-weight:bold;"> Feb 2024 </span> &nbsp <span  style="color:gray" > Excited to share that the <a style="color:gray" href="https://gfmip.org/">GFMIP</a> protocol paper is now published in JAMES! This has been a long and herculean effort, spearheared by the brilliant <a style="color:gray" href="http://jonah.org/">Jonah Bloch-Johnson</a> and backed up by a number of exceptional scientists from around the world. Looking forward to seeing this initiative bear fruit, so read the paper <a style="color:gray" href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2023MS003700/">here</a> and considering submitting simulations with your model! </span> &nbsp </p>
