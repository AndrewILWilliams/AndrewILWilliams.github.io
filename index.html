    Hi there! I'm a postdoctoral research associate at Princeton University and NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory. I got my PhD in 2023 from the <a "https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/research/subdepartment/atmospheric-oceanic-and-planetary-physics">Department of Atmospheric, Oceanic and Planetary Physics</a> at the University of Oxford.
    </p>
	
    <p>
    My research focuses on understanding the role that clouds and large-scale circulations play in the climate system and its response to human activities. This is a broad  Recent topics of interest include: tropical dynamics, radiative feedbacks, the hydrological cycle and aerosol radiative forcing.
