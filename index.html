    <p>
    Hi there! I am a PhD student in the Department of Atmospheric, Oceanic and Planetary Physics at the University of Oxford, where my advisor is <a href="https://www2.physics.ox.ac.uk/contacts/people/stier" >Prof. Philip Stier</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
   My research uses a range of different tools to understand how our planet responds to changes in aerosols (e.g. from pollution or wildfires) and greenhouse gases (e.g. CO<sub>2</sub>). I am particularly interested in understanding the role of clouds and large-scale circulations in climate change and connecting the results from complex models to basic, physical theory.

   <p> <span style="font-weight:bold;"> Aug. 2022 </span> &nbsp I was <a href="https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/news/meetandrew-williams" >interviewed</a> for Oxford's <span style="font-style:italic;">"Meet the Scientist"</span> series! Enjoy reading me rant about climate, cycling and my cat :) &nbsp
	   
   <p> <span style="font-weight:bold;"> July 2022 </span> &nbsp My most recent paper on aerosol effective radiative forcing was just <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-022-01415-4">published in Nature Climate Change!</a> Read a summary/explainer <a href="https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/news/understanding-absorbing-aerosol">here</a> :) &nbsp
	   
   <p> <span style="font-weight:bold;"> July 2022 </span> &nbsp I won an <a href="https://www.egu.eu/awards-medals/ospp-award/">Outstanding Student Presentation award</a> for my EGU conference presentation! :sunglasses: &nbsp
	   
   <p> <span style="font-weight:bold;"> May 2022  </span> &nbsp I attended the EGU22 conference (in-person!) and gave an <a href="https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU22/session/44036">invited talk</a> on my PhD work. :) &nbsp
	    
   <p> <span style="font-weight:bold;"> Apr. 2022 </span> &nbsp Our new paper <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2021MS002951?af=R">paper</a> was just published in JAMES! In it, we introduce a simple framework which links clouds and circulation by thinking about how they relate to the atmospheric water and energy budgets. &nbsp
	   
   <p> <span style="font-weight:bold;">	Feb. 2022 </span> &nbsp I received an <a href="https://www.agu.org/Learn-and-Develop/Learn/Student-Competitions/OSPA/OSPA-Winners?m-search-result=OSPA">Outstanding Student Presentation award</a> for my AGU conference presentation! :smile: &nbsp
	 
   <p> <span style="font-weight:bold;"> Dec. 2021 </span> &nbsp I attended my first AGU conference (virtually...)! While "there", I presented one poster on my PhD work, and gave a talk on my extreme precipitation paper with Paul O'Gorman <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2021GL096531">(now published in GRL)</a>. &nbsp

	   
   <p> <span style="font-weight:bold;"> Dec. 2021 </span> &nbspI contributed to a <a href="https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/14/7659/2021/gmd-14-7659-2021.html" >new paper in GMD</a>, led by the inimitable <a href="https://duncanwp.github.io/">Duncan Watson-Parris</a>. In it, we introduce a scalable, open-source framework for performing emulation and calibration of complex climate datasets - 'ESEm'! &nbsp
	   
   <p> <span style="font-weight:bold;"> Oct. 2019 </span> &nbsp I started my PhD! =D &nbsp
