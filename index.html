    <p>
    I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (remote). Prior to this, I was a research fellow at Princeton University and NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory. I received a Ph.D. in Physics from the University of Oxford in 2023.
    </p>

	<p>
    I study climate dynamics, with a focus on the tropical atmosphere and hydrological cycle. The goal of my research is to link emergent properties of the climate system to fundamental physics, which I achieve using both pencil-and-paper theory and a hierarchy of numerical models of the atmosphere and ocean. 
    </p>

    <p>
    I am actively involved in climate science outreach through <a style="color:gray" href="https://www.climateupclose.org/">Climate Up Close</a>.
