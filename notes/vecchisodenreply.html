   An informal reply to Vecchi and Soden (2007)
  </p>

  <p> <a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/20/17/jcli4258.1.xml" target="_self">Vecchi and Soden (2007)</a> (hereafter VS07) is a historically important paper, for a number of reasons. To my mind, it was one of the first papers which demonstrated that the strength of the tropical overturning circulation decreases in response to climate warming, and a major component of this weakening occurs in zonally-asymmetric circulations such as the Pacific Walker Circulation. These ideas were not unprecedented at the time, and many of the initial insights into the response of convective mass transport to warming go back to Betts’ 1998 essay
  <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1005323805826" target="_self">(Betts, 1998)</a>. The arguments of Betts (1998) were reframed and repopularized by <a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/19/21/jcli3990.1.xml" target="_self">Held and Soden (2006)</a>, and VS07’s primary contribution was that they explored these ideas in an ensemble of full-complexity climate models and showing that circulation weakening in response to warming is a robust prediction of GCMs. </p>
