   The Climate Response to Abrupt Stratocumulus Breakup
  </p>


     <p >    
	     When \(a \ne 0\), there are two solutions to \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and they are
$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$
    </p>

  <p> My first introduction to climate science came, somewhat by luck, during the summer of 2018. While searching for summer jobs I chanced upon Caltech’s Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (S.U.R.F. - what a name!), and there was a project advertised to work with Tapio Schneider’s group on cloud parameterization. I had no experience, but applied and then spent that summer exploring Southern California and learning to love clouds. Without that internship, I almost certainly wouldn’t be doing a PhD now! </p>	
	
  <p> In the second week of the internship there was a group meeting where <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/colleenkaul/" target="_self">Colleen Kaul</a> presented some in-progress work on the response of stratocumulus clouds to extreme warming in high-resolution, large-eddy simulations. A draft of the work was circulated beforehand and was one of the first climate science papers I ever read! A few months later, this humble draft went on to be published in Nature Geoscience as <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-019-0310-1" target="_self">‘Possible climate transitions from breakup of stratocumulus decks under greenhouse warming’</a>. The paper caused quite a stir in the media, with article titles such as <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/global-warming-spike-co2-carbon-dioxide-clouds-vanish-1342698" target="_self">‘Carbon Dioxide Could Make Clouds Vanish, Raising Global Temperatures by 8C’</a> peppering my news feed for weeks before the frenzy died down.  </p>

  <p>The main scientific result from this paper (in short) was that, because stratocumulus clouds are sustained by longwave radiative cooling from cloud top, and this cloud top radiative cooling decreases with increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases (CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O), eventually there reaches a level where the cloud top radiative cooling is too weak and the stratocumulus clouds dissipate into scattered cumulus clouds. In a model with a closed surface energy budget, this translates into a warming of the surface because stratocumulus decks reflect lots of incoming solar radiation compared to cumulus clouds (which generally have a much lower cloud fraction). </p>

</figure>
	
  <p>Schneider et al. then proceed to make a back-of-the-envelope estimate of how large a warming effect this ‘abrupt stratocumulus decimation’ would have on Earth’s climate. In the current climate, stratocumulus clouds reduce the net top-of-atmosphere shortwave radiation by about ~110 W m\(^{-2}\), compared to cumulus clouds for which this number is closer to 10 W m\(^{-2}\). Simple energy balance tells us that,
$$\Delta T = \frac{F}{\lambda},$$ where \(\lambda\) is the climate feedback parameter (W m\(^{-2}\) K\(^{-1}\)) and conceptualize the shift from stratocumulus to cumulus as a ‘forcing’ (F; W m\(^{-2}\)). Using CMIP5 estimate of lambda, the paper then calculates (110 − 10) W m\(^{-2}\) × 6.5% / 0.8 W m\(^{-2}\) K\(^{-1}\) ≈ 8 K global-mean surface warming when subtropical marine stratocumulus break up. The 6.5% factor accounts for the fact that stratocumulus clouds only occupy a small fraction of the Earth’s surface. </p>

	
  <p>This all seems well and good so far, and this is mostly where the conversation has stopped on this topic. The paper generated a huge splash at the time, but generally there hasn’t been much more work on this topic. This stark lack of follow-up research was noted by a recent <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2021RG000757" target="_self">review paper</a> on climate tipping points, which wrote:</p>
	
<blockquote>
	<i>"This climate feedback remains an emerging theory, presented in just a couple research publications to date. At this time of publication, virtually no follow-up research has robustly explored this hypothesis under different model conditions. [...] the significant temperature increase that would accompany stratocumulus cloud deck evaporation justifies further research attention to this potentially abrupt tipping element."</i>
</blockquote>

	<p>This lack of follow-up research is somewhat understandable, given that very high-resolution (and expensive) LES simulations are needed to fully capture the mechanisms of stratocumulus breakup. However, while explicitly modeling this stratocumulus breakup in a global climate model is computationally infeasible for the forseable future, I think that modeling the impact of an <i>idealized</i> stratocumulus breakup on climate could be a lot easier.</p>
	
	<p>One way of doing this would be to take a global climate model and simply make the stratocumulus clouds invisible to radiation (an approach similar to the <a href="https://pure.mpg.de/rest/items/item_2078839/component/file_2079076/content#:~:text=The%20Clouds%20On%20Off%20Klima%20Intercom%2D%20parison%20Experiment%20(COOKIE),on%20climate%20and%20climate%20change.">"COOKIE"</a> method). This approach of making low clouds invisible to radiation has been explored in a series of very nice PhD papers led by <a href="http://www.atmos.rcast.u-tokyo.ac.jp/ayumu/home.html">Ayumu Miyamoto</a>. These papers focused mostly on the subtropical circulation, but I think have already revealed a few interesting results related to Schneider et al's research. I'll summarize these below.</p>
	
	<p style="font-size:20px; color:black" >
   <u>1. Localization of warming</u>
  </p>

 </figure>
	
	<p>
		The back-of-the-envelope warming estimate from Schneider et al. does not make any statements about how that 8K of warming would be spatially <i>distributed</i>, and it's natural to wonder whether the warming would truly be "global". In <a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/35/1/JCLI-D-21-0178.1.xml">Miyamoto et al. (2022)</a> they disabled cloud radiative effects in the Southern Indian Ocean, which is a region inhabited by large swaths of stratocumulus, particularly in Southern Hemisphere summer (see their Figure 1). Below is a plot of the changes in SST and sea-level pressure in these experiments.
	</p>

  <figcaption > Figure 3 from Miyamoto et al. (2023), which shows the differences in annual, time-mean SST (grey shading) between the control and "noCRE" simulations. Note that here they are disabling cloud radiative effects over the Californian coast instead. </figcaption>
	</figure>
	
	<p>
		The most notable aspect of this figure (for me) is that the SST changes in these experiments are highly localized to the stratocumulus regions. In a similar set of experiments <a href="https://essopenarchive.org/users/596050/articles/629741-radiative-impacts-of-californian-marine-low-clouds-on-north-pacific-climate">Miyamoto et al. (2023)</a> also disabled cloud radiative effects from low clouds off the coast of California. Figure 3 from the preprint is shown below and again, it is notable that the warming remains highly localized and has a weak impact on SSTs in the rest of the basin.

   <u>2. Timescales of warming</u>
  </p>
	
	<figure style="float:right; width:500; margin: -0px 0px -0px 10px;">
  <img src="FiguresForNotes/Miyamoto2021FigS1.jpg" style="" width="500"  alt="Miyamoto2023Fig3.png"  >
  <figcaption > Figure S1 from Miyamoto et al. (2021). </figcaption>
 </figure>
	
	<p>
	  The localized warming response can be understood partially because these simulations are quite short (only around 50 years), and so the ocean-atmosphere system is far from equilibrium. In this transient phase, the ocean is able to absorb a lot of the excess energy accumulating in the climate system due to the stratocumulus breakup. For reference, the change in surface heat fluxes between the simulations is plotted in Figure S2 of Miyamoto et al. (2021) and shows a large increase in the ocean heat uptake over the "noCRE" region. The ocean heat uptake can also be seen in panel (d) of Figure S1 (right), which shows that the global-ocean temperatures are increasing faster in the "noCRE" experiment than the control experiment.
	</p>
	
	<p>While thinking about timescales, it's worth noting that the Schneider et al. paper frequently uses the term ‘abrupt’ to refer to the fact that, in their simulations, the transition from stratocumulus to cumulus occurs sharply as a function of the CO<sub>2</sub> change. However, I think some nuance was lost amid the media frenzy that accompanied the paper. For example, in the review paper on tipping points I mentioned before, they refer to these climatic changes as ‘rapid’, not ‘abrupt’, and their wording generally seems to imply that if stratocumulus clouds were to dissipate today, then the warming would happen incredibly quickly. However, that's not an aspect which Schneider et al. touch on, and also doesn't appear to be borne out by Ayumu's coupled runs.
	</p>

   <u>Concluding thoughts</u>
  </p>
	
	<p>
		My main take-away from all this is that the climate response to stratocumulus breakup is an interesting but under-researched topic, which could benefit from some idealized modeling. Some insights can already be gleaned from Ayumu's simulations, but it would be fruitful to run longer simulations to assess the timescales on which the warming patterns emerge. A few other interesting questions which I could imagine people exploring are:
	</p>
	
	<ol>
	<li>How "abrupt" <i>is</i> the warming response to stratocumulus breakup? Assuming all the stratocumulus decks instantly dissipated, how quickly would we reach the ≈8K of global-warming suggested by our back-of-the-envelope estimate?</li>	
  <li>Is the response to regional stratocumulus breakup <i>additive</i>? There are numerous stratocumulus decks across the Earth (Calfornian, Namibian, Peruvian etc), so how does the climate respond to simultaneous/separate removals of these decks?</li>
  <li>What extra uncertainty does this add to future climate projections? Schneider et al. estimate that stratocumulus breakup could occur at CO<sub>2</sub> levels of ≈1400ppm, which is not too far off from the abrupt-4xCO<sub>2</sub> scenarios we frequently run in CMIP models.</li>
	<li>What are the implications for understanding paleoclimate? The original paper suggests that this mechanism could help understand why GCM's fail to generate an ice-free Arctic at CO<sub>2</sub> levels suggested by Eocene proxies. A cool paper by <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2021PA004375">Henry and Vallis (2022)</a> shows that these estimates can be brought into closer agreement by altering clouds in their model, but they focused on Artic clouds rather than subtropical stratocumulus.</li>
