   The Climate Response to Abrupt Stratocumulus Breakup
  </p>


     <p >    
	     When \(a \ne 0\), there are two solutions to \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and they are
$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$
    </p>

  <p> My first introduction to climate science came, somewhat by luck, during the summer of 2018. While searching for summer jobs I chanced upon Caltech’s Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (S.U.R.F. - what a name!), and there was a project advertised to work with Tapio Schneider’s group on cloud parameterization. I had no experience, but applied and then spent that summer exploring Southern California and learning to love clouds. Without that internship, I almost certainly wouldn’t be doing a PhD now! </p>	
	
  <p> In the second week of the internship there was a group meeting where Colleen Kaul (https://sites.google.com/view/colleenkaul/) presented some in-progress work on the response of stratocumulus clouds to extreme warming in high-resolution, large-eddy simulations. A draft of the work was circulated beforehand and was one of the first climate science papers I ever read! A few months later, this humble draft went on to be published in Nature Geoscience (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-019-0310-1) as ‘Possible climate transitions from breakup of stratocumulus decks under greenhouse warming’. The paper caused quite a stir in the media, with article titles such as ‘Carbon Dioxide Could Make Clouds Vanish, Raising Global Temperatures by 8C’ (https://www.newsweek.com/global-warming-spike-co2-carbon-dioxide-clouds-vanish-1342698) peppering my news feed for weeks before the frenzy died down.  </p>

  <p>The main scientific result from this paper (in short) was that, because stratocumulus clouds are sustained by longwave radiative cooling from cloud top, and this cloud top radiative cooling decreases with increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases (CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O), eventually there reaches a level where the cloud top radiative cooling is too weak and the stratocumulus clouds dissipate into scattered cumulus clouds. In a model with a closed surface energy budget, this translates into a warming of the surface because stratocumulus decks reflect lots of incoming solar radiation compared to cumulus clouds (which generally have a much lower cloud fraction). </p>

  <p>Schneider et al. then proceed to make a back-of-the-envelope estimate of how large a warming effect this ‘abrupt stratocumulus decimation’ would have on Earth’s climate. In the current climate, stratocumulus clouds reduce the net top-of-atmosphere shortwave radiation by about ~110 W/m2, compared to cumulus clouds for which this number is closer to 10 W/m2. Simple energy balance tells us that,
$$\Delta T = \frac{F}{\lambda}$$,
