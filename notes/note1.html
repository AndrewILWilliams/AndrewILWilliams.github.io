     <p >    
	     When \(a \ne 0\), there are two solutions to \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and they are
$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$
	     Tropical high clouds ("anvils") mask outgoing infrared radiation and are thus an important player in the climate system. Our ability to simulate them, however, is known to be limited. Here we point out a further limitation, namely that even in cloud-resolving models, anvil cloud area is highly resolution-dependent (figure left). This resolution dependence is understood using the theory of <a href="papers/16anvils.pdf"> Seeley et al.  (2019)</a>, through which we demonstrate that at higher resolutions, mixing is more efficient at diluting convective plumes, reducing the efficiency with which they produce precipitation. Thus a greater number of plumes is required to produce the usual average rain rate (~3 mm/day), leading to greater high cloudiness. For details see <a href="papers/19iris.pdf"> Jeevanjee and Zhou  (2022)</a>.

  </figure>


     <p >   In follow-up work, we explore the dependence of convection on surface temperature, rather than resolution. There exist a few different rules of thumb for how convection should change with warming, but perhaps the most robust is shown at right: convective mass fluxes decrease throughout the troposphere with warming, especially when evaluated in temperature coordinates (i.e. on isotherms). These convective mass fluxes <i>M</i> are constrained to be equal and opposite to the subsidence mass flux &rho;w<sub>sub</sub> (dashed lines), which are well understood theoretically. This constraint is found to be more robust than other constraints pertaining to anvil clouds or to convective mass fluxes at cloud-base; for details see <a href="papers/21iris.pdf"> Jeevanjee (2022)</a>.
